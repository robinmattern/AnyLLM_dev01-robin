Msg to Discord

I currently have installed AnythingLLM on a vanilla ubuntu VM in the cloud.
- I've installed node, npm, and yarn (not so simple).
- I was able to clone AnythingLLM and then run yarn:setup.
- This didn't install Prisma, but I was able to get it installed from within the server folder.
- After letting ports 3000, 3001 and 8888 through the firewall, and adding `

    `VITE_API_BASE='http://155.138.193.41:3001/api`  to ./frontend/.env

I was able to get to the AnythingLLM GUI/app running in development mode.

I understand that you don't want to support this non-docker installation, but perhaps I can document how
to install such an instance and/or suggest a PR to fix a few glitches.

So if you are open to such an OS related question, I can't upload a web link either through the GUI, or using the API:

    `http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3001/api/docs/#/Documents/post_v1_document_upload_link (or http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3001/api/v1/document/upload-link)`

I see the following error in the yarn dev:frontend console:

    `getPageContent failed! Error: Failed to launch the browser process!`
    `/root/.cache/puppeteer/chrome/linux-119.0.6045.105/chrome-linux64/chrome: error while loading shared libraries: libasound.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

I believe this means that Chrome is not installed. The Ubuntu server is not running a desktop GUI, so
can you tell me how to install Chrome so that it is useable by puppeteer.
